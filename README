What is SimpleIDML ?
====================

SimpleIDML is a Python library to manipulate Adobe® InDesign® IDML file. The main purpose being the ability to 
compose IDML files together and produce complex documents from simple pieces and to separate the data from the structure.

The philosophy behind SimpleIDML is to keep separated the content and the structure and to use XML files to feed your documents.
Keeping this isolation is important to ease the debugging and to keep track of what is going on.
You can use the same XML file to build your IDML document and to fill it, but this is a second step done in InDesign through the
XML Import function.


What are IDML files ?
=====================

IDML (*InDesign Markup Language*) files are a Zip archives (Adobe calls them packages) storing essentially XML files. Adobe 
made a great step forward with this functionnality because those files can completely express the content of the native (binary) documents.
This is a small revolution in the print world when it comes to automatically process files in both ways (Round-trip). Everybody
speak XML. No more fragile *AppleScript* to construct a document. You don't even need the software to be installed on the machine
to works with IDML files, *that* is the revolution for us, developers and software architects.


What does SimpleIDML do ?
=========================

Package exploration
-------------------

The main functionality is to compose a document from pieces but you can discover the structure of your files::


    >>> from simple_idml import idml
    >>> my_idml_package = idml.IDMLPackage("/path/to/my_main_document.idml")
    >>> my_idml_package.spreads
    [u'Spreads/Spread_ub6.xml', u'Spreads/Spread_ubc.xml', u'Spreads/Spread_uc3.xml']
    >>> my_idml_package.stories
    [u'Stories/Story_u139.xml', u'Stories/Story_u11b.xml', u'Stories/Story_u102.xml', u'Stories/Story_ue4.xml']
    

Some attributes are *lxml.etree* Elements or Documents::

    >>> my_package.font_families
    [<Element FontFamily at 0x1010048c0>, <Element FontFamily at 0x101004a50>, <Element FontFamily at 0x101004aa0>,
        <Element FontFamily at 0x101004af0>]
    >>> [e.get("Name") for e in my_package.font_families]
    ['Minion Pro', 'Myriad Pro', 'Kozuka Mincho Pro', 'Vollkorn']

    >>> my_package.XMLStructure.dom
    <Element Root at 0x101004910>
    >>> from lxml import etree
    >>> print etree.tostring(my_package.XMLStructure.dom, pretty_print=True)
    <Root Self="di2">
      <article XMLContent="u102" Self="di2i3">
        <Story XMLContent="ue4" Self="di2i3i1">
          <title Self="di2i3i1i1"/>
          <subtitle Self="di2i3i1i2"/>
        </Story>
        <content XMLContent="u11b" Self="di2i3i2"/>
        <illustration XMLContent="u135" Self="di2i3i3"/>
        <description XMLContent="u139" Self="di2i3i4"/>
      </article>
      <article XMLContent="udb" Self="di2i4"/>
      <article XMLContent="udd" Self="di2i5"/>
      <advertise XMLContent="udf" Self="di2i6"/>
    </Root>
    

*XMLStructure* attribute is a representation of the XML Structure of your InDesign XML-ready document (The one you want 
to use to populate the content with data from an external XML file having the same structure).

Compose document
----------------


Using the XML Structure you can ask SimpleIDML to insert into a document at a XML tag the content of another XML tag from
another document. The tag paths are expressed using Xpath syntax (You should always make a copy of your idml files before
altering them with *shutil.copy2(src, dst)* for instance)::


    >>> from simple_idml import idml
    >>> idml_main = idml.IDMLPackage("/path/to/my_main_document.idml")
    >>> idml_module = idml.IDMLPackage("/path/to/my_small_document.idml")

    >>> idml_main = idml_main.prefix("main")
    >>> idml_article = idml_module.prefix("article")

    >>> idml_main = idml_main.insert_idml(idml_article, at="/Root/article[3]", only="/Root/module[1]")
    >>> idml_main.stories
    ['Stories/Story_article1u188.xml', 'Stories/Story_article1u19f.xml', 'Stories/Story_article1u1db.xml', 
     'Stories/Story_mainu102.xml', 'Stories/Story_mainu11b.xml', 'Stories/Story_mainu139.xml', 'Stories/Story_mainue4.xml']


    >>> print etree.tostring(idml_main.XMLStructure.dom, pretty_print=True)
    <Root Self="maindi2">
      <article XMLContent="mainu102" Self="maindi2i3">
        <Story XMLContent="mainue4" Self="maindi2i3i1">
          <title Self="maindi2i3i1i1"/>
          <subtitle Self="maindi2i3i1i2"/>
        </Story>
        <content XMLContent="mainu11b" Self="maindi2i3i2"/>
        <illustration XMLContent="mainu135" Self="maindi2i3i3"/>
        <description XMLContent="mainu139" Self="maindi2i3i4"/>
      </article>
      <article XMLContent="mainudb" Self="maindi2i4"/>
      <article Self="maindi2i5"/>
      <module XMLContent="article1u1db" Self="article1di3i12">
        <main_picture XMLContent="article1u182" Self="article1di3i12i1"/>
        <headline XMLContent="article1u188" Self="article1di3i12i2"/>
        <Story XMLContent="article1u19f" Self="article1di3i12i3">
          <article Self="article1di3i12i3i2"/>
          <informations Self="article1di3i12i3i1"/>
        </Story>
      </module>
      <advertise XMLContent="mainudf" Self="maindi2i6"/>
    </Root>


Always prefix your document before using *insert_idml* to avoid reference collisions.
